  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>A light and flavorful pizza featuring feta, tomatoes, and spinach. I like to use a homemade whole wheat crust, rolled thin. </p>
  
  
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

<u1>
    
    <li>- 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
    <li>- 1/2 cup diced onion </li>
    <li>- 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>- 1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry </li>
    <li>- 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil </li>
    <li>- 2 1/4 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>- ground black pepper to taste </li>
    <li>- 1 (14 ounce) package refrigerated pizza crust  </li>
    <li>- 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
    <li>- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
    <li>- 1 large tomato, thinly sliced </li>
    <li>- 1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs  </li>
    <li>- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>- 3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
</u1>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, place in oven to preheat.</p>

<p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and continue to cook and stir until all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and season with basil, lemon juice, oregano, and pepper. Allow mixture to cool slightly.</p>

<p>Unroll pizza dough on preheated pizza stone or a large baking sheet and brush with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Spread spinach mixture over dough, leaving a small border at the edge of the pizza crust. Top with 1 cup mozzarella cheese.</p>

<p>Press tomato slices into seasoned bread crumbs until coated; arrange tomatoes over pizza. Spread remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese and feta cheese over tomatoes.</p>

<p>Bake in preheated oven until pizza crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.</p>
